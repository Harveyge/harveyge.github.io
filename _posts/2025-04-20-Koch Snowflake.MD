Imagine you start with a perfectly ordinary equilateral triangle

1. **The Little Triangle Trick**  
   - Take each side of your big triangle and chop it into three equal pieces.  
   - On the middle piece, stick out a smaller, pointy triangle—like giving your triangle a little hat.  
   - Boom! One straight side just turned into four zig-zag segments.

2. **Repeat Forever (or Until Bedtime)**  
   Do the same “chop-and-hat” dance on **every** straight segment you have, again and again. After a handful of rounds, that once-smooth triangle looks like a lacy, frosty snowflake—except it never truly finishes growing.

3. **Why It’s So Cool**  
   - **Endless Coastline Vibes:** The boundary keeps getting longer, like a coastline that never stops.  
   - **Finite Snowball:** Even though its edge stretches off toward infinity, the area inside tops out at a nice, finite size. Magic!
