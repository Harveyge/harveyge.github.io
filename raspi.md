### Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision   
- **story:** Inspired during a summer camp thanks to "Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health- [CELEHS - Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/news/data-science-action-self-driving-cars)" in Summer 2023, I started to play Rasperry PI and self learned application of [You Only Look Once (YOLO)] (https://roboflow.com/)
- **goal:** I enjoys the python, Raspberry Pi, and Computer Vision application. I'd like to contribute **8â€“10** hours/week this summer to an interesting Raspberry Pi
