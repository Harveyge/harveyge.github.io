### Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision   
- **Thanks:** to a summer camp "Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health- [CELEHS - Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/news/data-science-action-self-driving-cars)" in Summer 2023, I was inspired to play [Rasperry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.com/),   and self learned the application of [You Only Look Once (YOLO)] (https://roboflow.com/) for interesting applications. Now I have trained / deployed several YOLO-based models on Rasperry Pi 5.  
- **goal:** I enjoys Computer Vision's applications on Raspberry Pi, and the magic behind. I'd like to contribute **8–10** hours/week during 2025 summer, to work on interesting Computer Vision, or Raspberry Pi projects.

Here are some interesting models I have trained / implemented, which runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 computer.
