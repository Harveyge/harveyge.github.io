##Hi, this is Haifeng Ge

I’m a rising 11th-grader at Sharon High School and a **USAJMO Qualifier (2025)**.  I thrive at the intersection of elegant proofs and hands-on computation, and I’m eager to contribute **8–10 hours/week** this summer to a research project in number theory, combinatorics, or computational mathematics.


This summer, I’m eager to contribute 8–10 hours/week to a research group—whether writing code, running experiments, or drafting proofs

### 🔬 Math and Python Blogs ***

1. **Prime-Gap Distribution**  
   Used Python & Sympy to examine gaps between consecutive primes up to 10⁶ and formulate a conjecture on average growth.  
2. **Quadratic Reciprocity Exposition**  
   Typeset a self-contained proof via Gauss sums; hosted on GitHub with full LaTeX source.  
3. **Ulam Spiral Visualization**  
   Plotted prime positions in a spiral grid to reveal surprising linear patterns.
