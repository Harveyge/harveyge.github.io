#Hi, this is Haifeng Ge

I am a rising 11th grade at Sharon High School and a USAJMO qualifier (2025). From my first taste of proof-based problem solving to leading my own team during local math competitions, I’ve dedicated myself to exploring both the theory and practice of mathematics.  

This summer, I’m eager to contribute 8–10 hours/week to a research group—whether writing code, running experiments, or drafting proofs

*(See [Projects](/projects/) for my computational notebooks and write-ups.)*


### 🔬 Research Interests

- **Analytic Number Theory**: prime-gap behavior, L-function experiments  
- **Algebraic Combinatorics**: generating-function techniques, graph-theoretic designs  
- **Computational Exploration**: data-driven conjecture testing using Python/Sympy/SageMath

I’m passionate about turning elegant theory into concrete experiments and proofs—and would be honored to join your lab this summer.
